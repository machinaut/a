<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
<br>I'm interested in making a Zettelkasten tool that I can use to make my own evergreen notes repository.
<br>
<br>The primary ingredients are: notes, ids, tags, and indexes.
<br>
<br>This is a note.  It's a short plain-text document that records my thoughts around some central idea.
<br>
<br>Right now notes are plain text, but I hope to have them become a little more sophisticated in the future.
<br>
<br>Every note has an id, which are '.' delimited numbers.  For example this note's id is '1'.
<br>
<br>A note's id never changes.  If I want to add to a note in the future, I can add another dot-suffix.
<br>
<br>E.g. If I write notes '1', and '2', and want to follow up with '1', I can write '1.1', and then '1.2'.
<br>
<br>The follow-ups might even get their own follow-ups, '1.2.1', '1.2.2', and so on.
<br>
<br>Tags are strings used to mark topics that are common to multiple notes.
<br>
<br>At the time of writing, this note has the "azet" tag, since "azet" is the name of the tool right now.
<br>
<br>Tags can change in the future.  The most boring way is to unify a bunch of ways of saying the same thing.
<br>
<br>E.g. "My Systems", "Systems", "Systems in Use" might all get re-named to a single tag "Systems".
<br>
<br>Tags also might change as my ontology changes.  In general I don't think I'll remove many tags, but I might replace them as I refine my thoughts.
<br>
<br>Indexes are auto-generated lists that make it easy to traverse notes.
<br>
<br>The ID Index links to all notes by id, in order.
<br>
<br>The Tag Index links to all notes with a given tag.</p>
<p>tags: <a href="/index.html#azet">azet</a></p>
<p>id: <a href="/1.html">1</a></p>
