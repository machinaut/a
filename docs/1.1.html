<h2>Future of this tool</h2>
<p>
<br>I hope that I will update and evolve this tool to suit my needs.
<br>
<br>Right now I expect to just use it plain, but quickly I expect I will want more features.
<br>
<br>It's possible that it would be useful to have every note have a title, which could be displayed when looking at indexes.
<br>
<br>Hyper-linking to other notes would be very useful.  So would hyper-linking to outside documents.
<br>
<br>It would be nice to have a more rich editor, that can handle formatting and linking and images.
<br>
<br>Unit tests would probably be useful for making sure I don't accidentally break things.</p>
