title: Future of this tool

I hope that I will update and evolve this tool to suit my needs.

Right now I expect to just use it plain, but quickly I expect I will want more features.

It's possible that it would be useful to have every note have a title, which could be displayed when looking at indexes.

Hyper-linking to other notes would be very useful.  So would hyper-linking to outside documents.

It would be nice to have a more rich editor, that can handle formatting and linking and images.

Unit tests would probably be useful for making sure I don't accidentally break things.
