title: What if I printed out everything?

I'm curious if it would be possible to print out everything I read on my computer.

(Not literally everything, many pages I only skim for a minute or two before closing.)

The idea is that every article that is worth more than 15 minutes of my time is probably worth indexing for posterity.

At the very least, maybe I should be digitally storing all of these into some archive for the future.

(The amount of storage costs to just save a pdf of every page/doc I read is probably not too bad.  I should probably do that estimate.)
