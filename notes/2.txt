title: How to track what I read

I read a lot of blog posts, forum comments, research papers, and more.

I don't have a great way of tracking what I read, or more importantly, what I thought about it.

Ideally it would be good for this notes system to be able to capture some of these.

Some possibilities:

1. Link-posts, where the note is centerally linked to another webpage or document.

2. Quoting or some way of capturing relevant passages from larger texts.

3. Reviews and summaries.
